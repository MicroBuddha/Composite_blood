# Composite Blood Cell Dataset & Segmentation Pipeline

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and methodology for our **Synthetic Composite Blood Cell Generation and Segmentation** project.  
The pipeline enables:
- **Class-specific segmentation** of white blood cell (WBC) types from raw microscopic images.
- **Synthetic composite image generation** in both *grid* and *background-based* styles.
- **Annotation handling** for detection/segmentation tasks.
- **Dataset augmentation** to improve robustness in downstream models.

We provide:
- All Python scripts (`.py`) for preprocessing, segmentation, and composite generation.
- Processed datasets (generated composites and masks).
- Instructions to reproduce experiments.

> âš  **Note**: The raw PBC and ALL-IDB datasets do not belong to us. Please download them from their official sources and cite them in any work.
